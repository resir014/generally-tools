## Car Physics Calculator

Use this simple tool to generate a realistic, scaled-down attributes for your GeneRally car files.

This tool is inspired mostly by [Haruna's Realistic Car Physics](http://forum.generally-racers.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=302).

### How to use

First, enter the real-life attributes of your car. Then click the "Calculate physics" button and it will calculate the scaled GR physics, rounded down to two decimal places.

A reference table for the Downforce values is available [here](http://resir014.github.io/generally-tools/downforce-reference/).

If you run into an issue, please file an issue report on GitHub or just on the GRIF thread.
